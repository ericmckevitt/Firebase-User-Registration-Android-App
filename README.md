# Firebase User Database Android App

In this project, I use Kotlin to develop a mobile app with a Firebase Realtime Database. This database stores user data, and the app implements CRUD functionality for this app. 

In this app, you can use the UI to create users with a form. Clicking on a user will allow you to edit the user's data through a form. To delete a user, you can just swipe left or right on the user. To delete all users, use the trash can icon in the action bar and follow the dialog to confirm your changes.
